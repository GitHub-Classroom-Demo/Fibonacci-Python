Assignment #2: Write a program to display all the Fibonacci numbers up until N

## Assignment

The goal of this assignment is for you to write a program that displays the Fibonacci numbers up until `n`. You are provided a Python file with starter code in `fib.py`.

## Example

In `fib.py`, there is a function called `fib(n)` where `n` is the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence. 

Calling `fib(1)` will give you the following output:

```
0
```

Calling `fib(5)` will give you the following output:

```
0 1 1 2 3 5
```
